      summary: Gets a community by ID
      description: >
        Note the reacts paramater in the community response is entierly 
        optional and may not be present. Also when implementing reacts 
        every community must return a like and dislike react. This is 
        so instances which implement an up/down vote system can use these 
        reacts for this. 
        
        Another item to note about reacts is that they contain a path and a 
        unicode property. Only one of these has to be set. The unicode property 
        should represent a single unicode character to be displayed as that 
        react. With the unicode for a react there is no length limit placed 
        on it becuase calculating the length of a unicode string is hard. For 
        example the character '🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿' has length 7/9 but only appears as a single 
        character.

      summary: Creates a new post
      description: |
        If the post is in response to another post, the `title` field must be
        set to `null`.

        Servers may decide which types of contnent they will accept as posts
        (including comments), however they must at least accept `text` content
        objects. If the server does not accept a particular type of content
        then it should return a `501` error.

        If a server can not render `markdown` content objects, it should
        display it as plain text (as opposed to rejecting the request).

        `content` can contain multiple objects containing different kinds of
        content. For example, `markdown` could be combined with a (not yet
        implemented) `poll` and/or `image` type, allowing text, images and a
        poll in a single post. However, only a single object of each kind is
        allowed and there are restrictions on certain combinations, currently
        `text` and `markdown` are mutually exclusive.

      summary: Return all known servers
      description: |
        Returns all of the servers that are known by the
        current server.

        The array should be ordered with more 'important'
        hosts at the beginning and the least 'important'
        at the end.

        The 'importance' of a server is implementation
        specific, but some examples include using the
        total number of posts made to that server by
        the current server.
